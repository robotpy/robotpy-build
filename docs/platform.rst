Platform-specific considerations
================================

cross-compilation
-----------------

We have successfully used `crossenv <https://github.com/benfogle/crossenv>`_ to
cross-compile python modules. For an example set of dockerfiles used to compile
for the RoboRIO platform, see the `robotpy-cross-docker <https://github.com/robotpy/robotpy-cross-docker>`_
project.
