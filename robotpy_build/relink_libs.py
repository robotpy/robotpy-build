"""
    On OSX, the loader does not look at the current process to load
    dylibs -- it insists on finding them itself, so we have to fixup
    our binaries such that they resolve correctly.
    
    Two cases we need to deal with
    - Local development/installation
    - Building a wheel for pypi
    
    In development, we assume things are installed exactly where they will be
    at runtime.
      -> @loader_path/{relpath(final_location, dep_path)}
    
    For pypi wheels, we assume that installation is in site-packages, and
    so are the libraries that this lib depends on.
      -> @loader_path/{relpath(final_siterel, dep_siterel)}
    
    Notice these are the same IF you only build wheels in a virtualenv
    that only has its dependencies installed in site-packages
    

    .. warning:: This will only work for the environment it's compiled in!
                 This basically means don't compile wheels in your development 
                 environment, use a clean environment instead
